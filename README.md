This Chess AI project is a Python-based application that simulates a chess game with an artificial intelligence opponent. The AI is powered by the Minimax algorithm with optimizations like alpha-beta pruning, allowing it to make strategic decisions. The game interface is implemented using the Pygame module, offering a visually appealing and interactive experience for players.

**Features**

- Player vs AI Mode: Play against the computer.

- Minimax Algorithm: The AI uses a depth-based minimax algorithm to evaluate moves.

- Alpha-Beta Pruning: Enhances the minimax algorithm for faster decision-making by eliminating unnecessary computations.

- Pygame Interface: A clean and interactive chessboard implemented using the Pygame library.

- Legal Moves Validation: Ensures that all moves comply with chess rules.

- Customizable Depth: Adjust the AI's difficulty by modifying the search depth.

**Requirements**

Install the pygame module
